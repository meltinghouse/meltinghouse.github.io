We awoke very early last Sunday morning and went to our very first [Upmarket Sunday](https://www.facebook.com/UpmarketSundays).

The event takes place at Huddersfield's Brook Street open market and is full with independent traders and artisans with handcrafted products. We were made to feel very welcome and met some great new people from the other businesses that were there. We can't wait to go back for the October market that takes place on Sunday 11th October... even if it does mean a ridiculously early start!

Here's are a few things that caught our eye whilst we were at Upmarket Sundays:

We were delighted to Yorkshire Halloumi on sale! The guys at [Yorkshire Dama Cheese](http://www.yorkshiredamacheese.co.uk/index.html) make their halloumi in Huddersfield using milk from cow that are just round the corner from our little chocolate shop! We drive past those cows regularly and now we know their milk makes the most delicious cheese, we will give them a little wave next time we go by.

Woody's Preserves make one of our favourite things - pickles! - as well as spicy jams and other yummy preserves.

Delicious Caribbean food from Capo.
