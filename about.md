Ey up! Welcome to the Melting House, where lovingly handmade chocolates and quirky treats are born. The Melting House girls are Emma and Claire, two sisters with a passion for choc! 

From our chocolate kitchen in the heart of Yorkshire we make everything by hand in small batches to ensure you get the best quality. From truffles, bars, slabs and shards, to Easter eggs, chocolate hampers and personalised chocolate.

All our chocolates are made by hand in our little chocolate kitchen in Yorkshire. You can buy online via our Etsy shop or get in touch for a cutom order.

Visit the [Melting House Etsy shop](http://www.etsy.com/shop/meltinghouse) to buy our chocolate online.
