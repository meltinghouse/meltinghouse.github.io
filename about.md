Hello, we're Emma and Claire, two sisters with a love for all things chocolate. Together we run Melting House, a chocolate shop and kitchen based in Yorkshire where we make small batches of handmade chocolate. From truffles, bars and slabs to Easter eggs, chocolate hampers, personalised chocolate gifts, cakes and baked goods; everything is made by hand here by us. 

Come along to our Mirfield shop to see chocolate making in action in the Melting House kitchen! You can also sit and watch the world go by with a speciality hot chocolate and a freshly made brownie.
