Melting House is a chocolate shop and kitchen in Yorkshire run by sisters, Emma and Claire.

Our chocolate is handmade in the kitchen of our shop in Mirfield.

Come along to our little corner of chocolate heaven, where you can taste our delicious creations, enjoy an indulgent hot chocolate and see the chocolate making in action in our kitchen.

We make all our own chocolate truffles, from classic favourites to seasonal specials.

Launching in October! Our hot chocolate menu is coming very soon. You can sit and watch the world go by with a delicious hot chocolate in our shop. Choose from a range of hot drinks, speciality hot chocolate and enjoy a freshly baked brownie.
